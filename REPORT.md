Most of the framework has been built.
The vector has been fully implemented.
The forward_list has been created and sorted but no calculations have been performed
the map has not been started. My thought process with map was to create key/value pairs of the name of the island and the lat/long.

I used std::sort to sort the data in the container. The items are sorted S/N, W/E properly
haven't checked the math so I am not sure if the calculation is accurate
